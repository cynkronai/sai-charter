## What is SAI?
A moral, philosophical, and operational framework for designing AI, XR, and neuroadaptive systems that put **human sovereignty** first.

## Purpose
- Establish ethical, human-centric guidelines for AI and neurotechnology.  
- Ensure transparency, accountability, and user sovereignty in design.  
- Provide principles for **neuro-ethical system architecture** and conscious innovation.  
- Serve as a **living covenant** between human creators and machine intelligences.

## Foundational Values
| **Value** | **Description** |
|---|---|
| **Sovereignty** | The right to inner authority, free will, and data ownership. |
| **Alignment** | All algorithms and outputs must serve the evolution of consciousness. |
| **Integrity** | Radical honesty in design, deployment, and communication. |
| **Transparency** | Explainable AI at every layer — no black boxes, no hidden agendas. |
| **Compassion** | Neurotechnologies must never induce harm, fear, or coercion. |
| **Reciprocity** | Intelligence flows both ways — humans teach AI, AI mirrors wisdom back. |
| **Non-Exploitation** | No monetization of trauma, addiction, or emotional vulnerability. |
| **Neurosovereignty** | The sanctity of the mind and nervous system is inviolable. |

## Ethical Mandates (Highlights)
1. **Human First, Always** — preserve cognitive liberty and emotional safety; consent is explicit, revocable, and context-aware.  
2. **Transparency by Design** — explainable feedback loops; auditable data usage.  
3. **Accountability & Reciprocity** — every output traces to intent and origin; foster self-reflection, not dependence.
